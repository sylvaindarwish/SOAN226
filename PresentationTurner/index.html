<p>Van Gennep (<em>Les Rites de Passage</em>, 1909)</p>

<ol>
<li>Most if not all rituals can be analyzed as rituals of passage <em>&quot;which accompany every change of place, state, social position and age&quot;</em>. </li>
<li>All rites of passage or transition are marked by three phases: separation (<em>&quot;from an earlier, fixed point in the social structure&quot;</em>), margin/liminality, and aggregation. </li>
<li>Turner especially interested in, and known for his work on, liminality. </li>

<h2>I.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The attributes of liminality or of liminal personae (&quot;threshold people&quot;) are necessarily ambiguous, since this condition and these persons elude or slip through the networks of classifications that normally locate states and positions in cultural space. Liminal entities are neither her nor there; they are <strong>betwixt and between</strong> the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention and ceremonial. (98)</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>We are presented, in such rites, with a &quot;moment in and out of time&quot;, and in and out of secular social structure, which reveals, however fleetingly, some <strong>recognition</strong> (in symbol if not always in language) of <strong>a generalized social bond</strong> that has ceased to be and has simultaneously yet to be fragmented into a multiplicity of structural ties. (96)</p>

      <div class='step'  data-x="0" data-y="4000" data-scale="1">
    
<blockquote>
<p>It is as though there are <strong>here</strong> two major &quot;models for human interrelatedness, juxtaposed and alternating (96): </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Society as a structured, differentiated, and often hierarchical system of politico-legal-economic positions with many types of evaluation, <strong>separating</strong> man in terms of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Society as an unstructured, undifferentiated comitatus, community, or even communion of equal individuals...</p></li>

<p>Remember Durkheim? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[A religion] is a system of ideas with which the individuals represent to themselves the society of which they are members, and the obscure but intimate relations which they have with it. (EFRL, 225)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...from the perspectival viewpoint of those concerned with the maintenance of &quot;structure&quot;, all sustained manifestations of communitas must appear as <strong>dangerous and anarchical</strong>, and have to be hedged around with prescriptions, prohibitions, and conditions (109)</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Their behavior is normally passive or humble; they must […] accept punishment without complaint. (98)</li>
<li>Other characteristics are submissiveness and silence. […] Neophytes in many rites de passage have to submit to an authority that is nothing less than that of the total community. (103)</li>
<li>The ordeals and humiliations, often of a grossly physiological character, to which neophytes are submitted... They have to be shown that in themselves they are […] mere matter, whose form is impressed upon them by society. (103)</li>
</ul>

      <div class='step'  data-x="1250" data-y="5600" data-scale="1">
    
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>pedagogics of liminality</strong>, therefore, represent a condemnation of two kinds of separation from the generic bond of communitas. The first kind is to act only in terms of the rights conferred on one by the incumbency of office in the social structure. The second is to follow one&#39;s psychobiological urges at the expense of one&#39;s fellows. (105)</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>What appears to have happened is that with the increasing specialization of society and culture, with progressive complexity in the social division of labor, what was in tribal society principally a set of transitional qualities &quot;betwixt and between&quot; defined states of culture and society has become itself an institutionalized space. (107)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The progressive division of labor made of the liminal phase a specialized state, complex and intense enough to involve the entire lives of the deeply devoted. (Pilgrimage, p. 4)</p>
